# Deploys (optionally after building) the old Concordium Network Dashboard.
#
# Usage:
#
#   NETWORK_DASHBOARD_IMAGE=<image> NETWORK_DASHBOARD_PORT=<port> COLLECTOR_BACKEND_DOMAIN=<domain> docker-compose up
#
# where
#   <image>: The name of the image to use or build (default: "network-dashboard").
#   <port>: The port to start the service on (default: 8080).
#   <domain>: The domain on which the Concordium Collector Backend is running.
#             This equals the URL that the official Network Dashboard instance of the network
#             used to be deployed to, i.e.:
#             - Mainnet: dashboard.mainnet.concordium.software (default)
#             - Testnet: dashboard.testnet.concordium.com
#
# Example: Build and run image with name 'network-dashboard' on port 8080:
# - Mainnet: docker-compose up
# - Testnet: COLLECTOR_BACKEND_DOMAIN=dashboard.testnet.concordium.com docker-compose up
#
# Note that since the dashboard automatically refreshes its data continuously,
# you can stop the server and start it again on a different network.
# The page will then immediately start showing data from the new network.
